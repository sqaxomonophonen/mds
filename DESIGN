Stage 0:
 - Contains golfed base-123 118-bit decoder => rANS decoder (see:
   b123n118ransdecoder.js)
 - JavaScript ("Stage 1") is decoded from the first input section and evaluted.
   Edit javascript_symboldefs.json to compress recurring substrings better.
 - Decoder is "left open" for stage 1+
Tool chain:
 - text2ransinput.js: given symbol definitions and text input, it generates
   symbol list for tool_ransencode.c and
 - tool_ransencode.c: encodes symbol list to binary
 - tool_b123n118encode.js encodes binary data as a base-123 118-bit string

Stage 1:
 - Contains player and song code
 - Continues to decode/decompress input stream to read pattern data, PCM data,
   and/or what it needs
 -
